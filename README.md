These are projects done during my time as a student

As of the moment, I have only completed two data analysis project. One is done in R and demonstrates my ability to use machine learning,
specifically supervised learning to make predictions on a dataset. Another is done in Python where I web scraped 200 Linkedin job ads and performed some
analysis on them.
