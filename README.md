# Portfolio
Projects done during my time as a student

This is my portfolio where I've complied all the major projects I've done that show off my skills in statistical analysis. One of the projects is done in R (141A) where
I used a couple supervised learning techniques to detect credit card fraud. Another is done in Python (STA 141B) 
and it shows off how I used web scrapping to collect data from Linkedin and did a lot of exploratory data analysis to gain insight. I also utilized NLP to gain insight from the texts in the Linkedin Ads. Another project (ECS 171) showcases my skills in ML to prevent scams for secondhand cars which utilizes multiple models for regression (on car prices) and classification (for the number of owners). Finally, I have a project that's quite niche and works with Image data (STA 160).
